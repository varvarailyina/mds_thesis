## Emotion Analysis in German Parties' Press Releases

Political parties don't just inform â€” they express:

ðŸ˜  ðŸ˜¨ ðŸ¤¢ ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜„ ðŸ¤© ðŸ˜Œ ðŸ¥º

This project tracks how and when these emotions show up in 40,000+ press releases from 6 German parties in 2010-2019.  

---

### Project Overview

I classify eight emotions â€” anger, fear, disgust, sadness, joy, enthusiasm, pride, and hope â€” using a pre-trained transformer-based language model (GELECTRA) fine-tuned on German political text.
The results are aggregated to the document level and analyzed across parties, time, and issue categories.

### Methodology

**Dataset**  
Based on the PARTYPRESS dataset, filtered for German-language press releases from 2010â€“2019.  
Final sample: 41,523 documents with 453,410 sentences.

**Pre-processing**  
- Removal of outliers based on word count (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles)
- Sentence-level splitting for compatibility with GELECTRA

**Emotion Classification**  
Sentence-level inference using GELECTRA

- [GitHub: 3x8emotions](https://github.com/tweedmann/3x8emotions)
- [HuggingFace: GELECTRA](https://huggingface.co/german-nlp-group/electra-base-german-uncased)

The model predicts the probability of each of the eight emotions per sentence.  
Predictions are then merged back with the metadata and aggregated to the press release level.

**Aggregation**  
Document-level measures:

- *Emotion intensity*: total emotion mentions per sentence
- *Emotion share*: proportional distribution of each emotion per press release

These outputs are used for visualization and downstream analysis.
